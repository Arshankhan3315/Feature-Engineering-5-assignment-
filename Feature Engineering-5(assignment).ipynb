    "# Answer-1-Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical format, but they differ in how they handle the encoding of the categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding:Ordinal encoding is a type of encoding that is used when the categorical data has an inherent order or ranking among the categories. In this method, each category is assigned a unique integer value based on its position or order. For instance, categories like 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high' might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Ordinal encoding implies a ranked relationship between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label Encoding:Label encoding, on the other hand, is a more general technique used for converting categorical data into numerical form. It assigns a unique integer to each category without considering any inherent order or hierarchy. Each category is assigned a different integer without any ranking implication. For instance, categories like 'red,' 'green,' and 'blue' might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:Let's consider an example of a dataset containing the education level of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding: Suppose the education levels are 'High School,' 'Associate's Degree,' 'Bachelor's Degree,' 'Master's Degree,' and 'Ph.D.' In this case, since there's a clear order among the education levels, you might choose to use ordinal encoding to represent these levels with integer values such as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, to maintain the hierarchy of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label Encoding: If you have a different categorical feature in the same dataset, such as 'Color' with categories 'Red,' 'Green,' and 'Blue,' and there is no inherent order among these colors, label encoding would be more appropriate. Each color category would be assigned a different integer without implying any ordinal relationship among them."

    "\n",
    "# Calculate the average default rates (target variable) for each 'Credit Score Category.'\n",
